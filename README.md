# What is this?
This is my project at making a form app with C# and .net technology in which A Note can be prepared by adding Title, Description and Creation Date and save it. It is much useful, as it saves data in Sql table, so one could access the data even after closing the application. 

#How it works?
This application provides user friendly environment as all the values can be filed easily with tab and enter key without draging mouse keys much.
Firstly a datepicker is present which automatically get current date, then Textbox for -Title focuses and on pressing enter it focuses on -Description box and after focus goes on save and data will be saved by Save btn.
The data will be save in Sql Table and also displays it in datagrid present there through which you can access or see the list of notes with dates.

There present Read, New, Save and Delete button.

# Conclusion...
It will help to store the short notes on daily basis and analysis and access whenever needed.
